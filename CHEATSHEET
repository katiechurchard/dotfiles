TC Random Cheatsheet for tmux, vim, git, etc

tmux
----

bash_aliases: tm alias for attach or new.  EG bash$ tm fish    will start a new session or attach to an existing one by that name

In .tmux.conf I've remapped ctrl+b to ctrl+h.  (vim uses for window scroll backwards.)

ctrl+h |        to split the window vertically
ctrl+h -        to split the window horizontally
ctrl+h h j k l  to navigate between split windows (left down up right)
ctrl+h d        to detach


vim
---

ctrl+n to toggle the nerdtree


git
