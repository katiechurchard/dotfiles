TC Random Cheatsheet for tmux, vim, git, etc


tmux
----

bash_aliases: tm alias for attach or new.  EG bash$ tm fish    will start a new session or attach to an existing one by that name

In .tmux.conf I've remapped ctrl+b to ctrl+h.  (vim uses for window scroll backwards.)

ctrl+h |        to split the window vertically
ctrl+h -        to split the window horizontally
ctrl+h h j k l  to navigate between split windows (left down up right)
ctrl+h d        to detach

ctrl+h c        to create a new session/buffer
ctrl+h s        to select session/buffer from list
ctrl+h 1        to switch to session/buffer 1

ctrl+h [        to enter scroll mode then up/down to pgUp/pgDown to scroll.  ctrl+c to exit.

---

git
---

# aliases

br   : show verbose git branch all
bd   : branch difference eg bd dev..dev-ab will show the different commits on dev-ab from dev
bdv  : same as bd more verbose
ci   : commit
co   : checkout
cp   : cherry-pick
df   : diff
dl   : fetch --prune
lg   : log --stat
lgv  : verbose log with branch graph
lgs  : short log with branch graph
me   : merge --ff-only
st   : status
up   : rebase
sq   : rebase -i

# not alias'd

stash : ci is easier where ci --amend or sq can be used

branch : I rarely run this (git co -b to create branches, git br to list)

git show branch:file : short

git push : short
